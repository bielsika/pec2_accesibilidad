            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <cite>by <span class="articleauthor">Markus H. Hefter</span> et al · March 10, 2023</cite>
                <p>In recent years, COVID-19 policy measures massively affected university teaching. Seeking an effective and viable way to transform their lecture material into asynchronous online settings, many lecturers relied on prerecorded video lectures.</p>

                <h3>The risks of asynchronous video lectures: interruptions and lack of engagement</h3>
                <p>Asynchronous video lectures enable learners to choose their time and location of learning, but also carry some risks, such as interruptions and lack of students’ engagement. First, the risks of getting interrupted by other people, devices, or noises may be bigger in an unsupervised place of one’s own choice than in the university hall or classroom (<cite class="mention">Benson, Blasiman</cite> et al). After all, the lecturer’s presence might have at least some corrective influence to assure a quiet learning environment.</p>                
                <p>However, interruptions by digital devices are a ubiquitous phenomenon that afflicts many learners, gaining notoriety under the phrase digital distraction (<cite class="mention">Flanigan & Titsworth</cite>) and the euphemism media multitasking. Students simply <strong>cannot withstand succumbing to use their mobile devices</strong> (such as smart phones, tablets, and laptops) for off-task purposes, which they do to an excessive extent.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Prompts for self-explanations</h3>
                <p>As mentioned above, we are focusing on self-explaining as the key learning activity to encourage students to benefit from a given video lecture. Note that self-explaining is not the present participle that describes self-explanatory learning material. Self-explaining is the gerund; it is an ongoing activity that simply means generating an explanation to oneself. Decades of research revealed that the endeavor of self-explaining is a powerful learning strategy, a constructive cognitive endeavor (<span class="dotted">e.g.,</span> <cite class="mention">Bichler</cite><span class="dotted"> et al</span>).</p>
                <p>In the context of learning from explanations, active and constructive prompts can be distinguished. This differentiation is based on the <em>active–constructive–interactive framework</em> by <cite class="mention">Chi</cite> —a predecessor of the aforementioned <abbr title="active-constructive-interactive framework">ICAP</abbr> framework.</p>

                <h3>Hypotheses</h3>
                <p>In the present study, we supplemented a prerecorded video lecture on the topic Cognitive Apprenticeship with different kinds of prompts and compared those types in an online field experiment. Against the previously discussed background, we aimed to investigate the instructional efficacy of different types of prompts (<span class="dotted">e.g.</span>, note prompts, principle-based self-explanation prompts, elaboration-based self-explanation prompts, and both) on students’ learning processes and learning outcomes. Furthermore, we examined the roles of learners’ engagement in the form of interruptions (<span class="dotted">e.g.</span>, self-reports on how often they were interrupted by other people or events/incidents) and persistence (<span class="dotted">e.g.</span>, actual participation in a delayed posttest).</p>
                <p>Referring to learning processes and as a manipulation check, we predicted that…</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Principle-based self-explanation prompts would foster principle-based self-explanations (<strong>Hypothesis 1a</strong>).</li>
                    <li>Elaboration-based self-explanation prompts would foster elaboration-based self-explanations (<strong>Hypothesis 1b</strong>).</li>
                        <li>Combined principle- and elaboration-based self-explanation prompts would foster both principle-based and elaboration-based self-explanations (<strong>Hypothesis 1c</strong>).</li>
                    </ol>
